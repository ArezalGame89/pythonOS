# ChungOS Rewrite

ChungOS Rewrite is a rewrite of ChungOS, I was a programmer for ChungOS too but it was too messy to work with so I rewrote it.

In my opinion the rewrite turned out better than I expected. You can view it on [Github](https://github.com/Iemane291/chungos_rewrite) right now. 

It's version is v0.0.1

Then clone this repository with Git by copying the link when you click the code button and opening a terminal and typing in `git clone thelinkyougot` or click the code button and download the zip instead and extract it.

Go to the terminal and change directory to the repository folder.

And you've got everything installed, head to the "Running" section now.
