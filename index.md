pythonOS is based off of [ChungOS](https://github.com/ArezalGame89/ChungOS), pythonOS is the more better and optimized version of [ChungOS](https://github.com/ArezalGame89/ChungOS).

pythonOS features:
- Lua script support using [lupa](https://pypi.org/project/lupa)
- Simple and colorful interface using [colorama](https://pypi.org/project/colorama) and [inquirer](https://pypi.org/project/inquirer)
- Changeable options that change your experience. 
- Much, much more (is yet to come).

Currently, we are on version 3.0.2A

## Getting Started

### As a first-time user:
So what you'll need to install is:

- [Python 3.10.0](https://python.org/downloads/) or a higher version.
- [Git-scm](https://git-scm.com/download)


Then open the terminal and change the directory to where you want pythonOS to be instaled and then just type `git clone https://github.com/Iemane291/pythonOS.git` and it should start installing.

Once it has finished installing, you can do `cd pythonOS` in the terminal and do one of these commands depending on what operating system you use.

Windows: `py -m pip install -r requirements.txt`

Mac: `python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt`

Linux: `python -m pip install -r requirements.txt`

> The Linux command is untested.

Then it should install all the libraries (view the libraries in the requirements.txt file if you are suspicious of what libraries are installed) you need.

Once that is finished, you can finally run one of these commands depending on what operating system you use.

Windows: `py main.py`

Mac: `python3 main.py`

Linux: `python main.py`

> The Linux command is untested.

And that is it!

### As a user

Assuming you have everything installed (if not, please read the As a first-time user section) You can just open the terminal, change the directory to where the pythonOS folder is located and then do one of these commands depending on what operating system you use:

Windows: `py main.py`

Mac: `python3 main.py`

Linux: `python main.py`

> The Linux command is untested.

### As a developer

Assuming you use an IDE, here's what you can do to easily run pythonOS.

Run one of these commands depending on what IDE you use.

Visual Studio Code: Assuming you have the Python extension installed, you can click the run (the play button looking one) button and it should run in the integrated terminal.

Sublime Text: Assuming Sublime has an integrated terminal & you've already installed what you need (if you don't know what to install, read the As a first-user section), you can just do one of these commands in the integrated terminal.

Windows: `py main.py`

Mac: `python3 main.py`

Linux: `python main.py`
