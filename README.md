# What is this?

This used to be a [ChungOS](https://github.com/ArezalGame89/ChungOS) rewrite but it's implemented too much of it's own features so I renamed it.

This is an open-source modification/rewrite of ChungOS, aiming to be more usable and better than ChungOS.


# Installation
First install [Python 3.10.0](https://python.org/downloads) or higher.

Then clone this repository with [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads/) by going to the terminal and typing `git clone https://github.com/Iemane291/pythonOS.git` (make sure you have [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) installed) or click the code button and download the zip instead and extract it.

Go to the terminal and change directory to the repository folder.

Do `pip3 install -r requirements.txt` to install what's required

And you've got everything installed, head to the "Running" section now.

# Running

Run one of these commands depending on your OS:

- Windows: `py main.py`

- Mac: `python3 main.py`

- Linux: `python main.py`
